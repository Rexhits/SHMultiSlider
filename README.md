# SHMultiSlider

## A rotary knob with 2 sliders for macOS, good for display value and range selection.
### Installation
SHMultiSlider is written in Swift 4.2, so your code has to be written in Swift 4.x due to current binary compatibility limitations.

### CocoaPods
To use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) add SHMIDIKit to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SHMultiSlider'
```
Then run `pod install`.
